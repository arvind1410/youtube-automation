Over the past decade, Israels economy has experienced annual growth of 3.5%, primarily driven by an increase in employment rates. However, the countrys productivity growth has lagged behind, posing a challenge for its long-term economic competitiveness. Without significant reforms, Israels relative GDP per capita is expected to deteriorate, further widening the gap with comparable OECD countries. So, what are the main factors contributing to this productivity gap? A macroeconomic analysis points to three key policy-related factors: First, there is a need for increased public investment, particularly in transportation infrastructure and information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure. Insufficient investment in these areas has hindered productivity growth and limited the countrys ability to compete with benchmark OECD economies. Second, there is a shortage of human capital, primarily among individuals without academic education. While Israel has a highly skilled workforce, the lack of vocational training opportunities has prevented many from accessing higher-paying jobs. Addressing this gap is crucial to boost productivity and bridge the GDP per capita divide. Lastly, the heavy regulatory and bureaucratic burden on the business sector has hampered efficiency and innovation. Streamlining regulations and reducing unnecessary red tape will create a more favorable environment for businesses to thrive, leading to increased productivity and economic growth. The crucial question is: how can Israel overcome these challenges and fuel productivity growth? Our proposed comprehensive economic strategy revolves around three main pillars: First, there needs to be a significant increase in public infrastructure investment, with a focus on transportation and ICT. By enhancing connectivity and digital capabilities, Israel can attract more businesses, boost productivity, and drive economic growth. Second, it is imperative to establish a post-secondary vocational education and training (VET) system parallel to the existing academic system. This will provide individuals without higher education opportunities to gain valuable skills and contribute to the workforce, ultimately narrowing the productivity gap. Lastly, reducing the bureaucratic and regulatory burden on businesses is essential. By simplifying processes and eliminating unnecessary regulations, the government can foster a more business-friendly environment, encouraging innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth. Its important to note that other countries have successfully implemented similar strategies to boost productivity and economic growth. Learning from these success stories can provide valuable insights and guide Israel in its pursuit of greater economic competitiveness. In conclusion, Israels productivity gap poses a significant challenge to its economic prosperity. By addressing the factors influencing productivity growth, including public infrastructure investment, human capital development, and regulatory reforms, Israel can unlock its full potential and achieve higher GDP per capita. Its time for a comprehensive economic strategy that sets the stage for a more competitive and prosperous future.
